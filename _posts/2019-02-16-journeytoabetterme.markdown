My journey to learn how to be a software developer actually started a year and a half ago in a dark room at an all time health low for myself. Unable to do anything else but lay in bed to try and recover was frustrating, to say the least. I was a young mom that felt like I couldn't help my family, that made me determined to find a line of work that I could do  to earn a living for my family. I new that this line of work I needed to be able to do no matter my condition and most importantly that I loved. Now I relize that sounds like a wildly depressing way to start a new skill, and your not wrong but hold on this was just the start. I hunted around and eventally found front end development was and interest I had and in 3 months I had taught myself how to build websites with free sources like free code camp and eventaully a paid bootcamp at Skillcrush.

This taught me how much fun it was to build something from scratch using code. I was hooked I was excited to go through my courses every day to build off of my knowleadge and really create something. It was like the really excallent puzzles in a Zelda video game for me. Codeing brought me much needed joy to my life as I got healthy again. That November in 2017 I got hired as a Front end developer at a Marketing Compmany called Madwire. This last year has been the most rewarding year I've had in my adult life. Most of my knowleadge though has stayed some where in the realm of HTML, CSS, some Javascript, and Wordpress PHP. I felt the hunger to expand my skill set into hopefully a more full understanding of what I enjoy.

I am currently a part of Flatiron Schools Sofware Engneering program in hopes to be able to actually fill in some of the knowleadge gaps that sometimes occur when you teach yourself something. I am extatic to learn about object oriented coding as well as building backends and applying API's. I have great hope that this will enable me to get to my ultimate goal of build mobile apps, and web app's. I hope to work in this area eventually  but even if it is just as a hobby I really want to build something the pushes my creative boudries that is beutiful and elegant that can be enjoyed by many.

Please join me on my journey to a better me.
