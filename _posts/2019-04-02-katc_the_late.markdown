So as I start this blog post almost a month later than expected I feel reflection is required for the biggest killer in progress... time management. At work we have a queue system where in you can set timers for how long you have to complete a project. In self betterment and self paced studies their is no queue system.
My resolve to learn better time management skills has made me realize that the information I found could be helpful to others. So death to procrastination lets dive into this list:

1. The pomodoro technique - for those who don't know what this is its very handy for maximizing productivity while keeping on track of your time. The pomodoro technique breaks down any time your focused working into 25 min increments with a 5 min break. After 4 rounds of 25 : 5 min incramates you talk a 15 min break. This is where your brain is most productive as well as lets you take a break to let the information proccess in your brain!


2.  An apple a day - This isn't litteral but it's the idea that a little a day can accomplish great things. In this case at Flatiron's bootcamp that I'm taking I had bee trying to do too much at once, which in time ment procrastination set in. even if you only get trough one Pomodoro round a day it will add to a greater sum.


3. Think outside the box about what your working on. For me I had been feeling like the work I was doing was "homework" and the long forgotten reblious teen awoke saying "Ain't nobody got time for that". Then I reilzed the inherate flaw in my thinking. I have found if I veiw the over hang titles like classes and allow myself to move to a different "class" if I am stuck it allowed me freedom to learn something new and come back to the problem. This was  out of my box and has help me be exicted again. WHATEVER WORKS FOR YOU.

Thank you and stay tuned to a more timely update.
